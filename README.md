- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohanssonRein, an undergrad mathematican
-
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cooking, curling, and video games like Warframe, ETS2, Halo, Minecraft, GTA, and of course, mathematics.

- My research interests in math are analysis, PDE, and probability theory, with a bit application toward machine learning.
-
- I am an aviation fan, I love exploring airplanes at airports all over the world : as you can tell from my profile picture,
- which was taken inside an A320 cabin on my trip to Toronto. My favorite aircraft is Boeing 787, which I have boarded more than 10 times.
- 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently majring Honors Applied Mathematics at McGill Univerity, Montreal, Canada.
