- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohanssonRein, a mathematican. I am an undergrad at McGill University.
-
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cooking, curling, and video games like Warframe, ETS2, MSFS, Halo, Minecraft, GTA, and of course, mathematics.

- My research interests in math are probability theory, mathematical statistics, with a bit application towards machine learning and random graph theory.
-
- I am an aviation fan, I love exploring airplanes at airports all over the world.
