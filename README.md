- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohanssonRein
-
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cooking, curling, and video games like Warframe, GTA, and of course, programming.
-
- I am an aviation fan, I love exploring airplanes at airports all over the world : as you can tell from my profile picture,
- which was taken inside an A320 cabin on my trip to Toronto. My favorite aircraft is Boeing 787, which I have boarded more than 10 times.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Honors Statistics and Computer Science at McGill Univerity, Montreal, Canada.
